        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p>We are a group of Napier students who have come together to build something different — a website that doesn’t just tell you about the past, but actually helps you experience it. Each of us picked a decade we were passionate about and designed a whole page around it, using a mix of research, creativity, and our own styles to bring everything to life.</p>
        <p>Our team shares a passion for music, sports, history, and fashion, and we wanted to pass that excitement on to you in a way that’s easy and fun to explore. Whether you’re into the retro vibes of the '70s, the neon madness of the '80s, or the pop culture explosion of the 2000s, there’s something here for everyone. ThrowbackTo.com is a collection of stories, styles, and memories that helped shape the world we live in today.</p>
