        <div class="swiper">
            <div class="swiper-wrapper">
                <div class="swiper-slide">WEDDING OF CHARLES & DIANA
                    <p>Diana Spencer wed Charles, Prince of Wales, heir presumptive, at London's St. Paul's Cathedral on July 29, 1981.  Additionally, the occasion was incredibly flamboyant.  It attracted two million spectators to the streets of London, cost an estimated $100 million in today's currency, and was declared a public holiday in the United Kingdom.  However, that pales in comparison to the 750 million people who watched from home.</p></div>
                <div class="swiper-slide">The 1980 Moscow Olympics <p>The '80s were a great decade for the Olympics. Moscow '80, Los Angeles '84, and Seoul '88 each attracted roughly two billion viewers. But the Moscow games are historic in so many ways. They were the first Olympics ever to be held in Eastern Europe and the first summer Olympics ever to be held in a communist nation. </p> <p>Accordingly, dozens upon dozens of nations boycotted the games and stayed away - 66, to be exact. Only 80 showed up, making this the smallest Olympics in almost 25 years.</p></div>
                <div class="swiper-slide">JOHN LENNON ASSASSINATION
                    <p>On the evening of 8 December 1980, John Lennon, the British singer and former Beatle, was shot and critically wounded in the archway of the Dakota, his New York City apartment building. On 14 December 1980, one week after the music icon's death, millions of people worldwide participated in 10 minutes of silence to honor Lennon at the behest of Yoko Ono.</p>
                    <p>It is difficult to exaggerate the legacy and influence of John Lennon 41 years after his death, and the fact that his presence remains today is evidence of this.</p></div>
                <div class="swiper-slide">THE TIANANMEN PROTESTS(1989)<br> <br>The Tiananmen Square protests, known in China as the June Fourth Incident, were student protests in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, China, from 15 April to 4 June 1989.<br>Repeated failures at negotiation over several weeks to achieve a peaceful resolution, the Chinese government moved troops into the square during the night of 3 June in what became known as the Tiananmen Square massacre. The protests are also referred to as the '89 Democracy Movement, the Tiananmen Square Incident, or the Tiananmen uprising.</div>
                <div class="swiper-slide">1983 COUP<br> <p>A military coup led by Major General Muhammadu Buhari ousted the democratically elected government of President Shehu Shagari. This marked the end of the Second Nigerian Republic. "This incident was one of the major contributing factors to the coup, as it placed the civilian government and military on opposite sides of a highly divisive issue." (“1983 Nigerian coup d'état - Wikipedia”)<p>There was a coup orchestrated by Major General Muhammadu Buhari that overthrew the democratically elected government of President Shehu Shagari, bringing an end to the Second Nigerian Republic. The coup was one of the significant contributing factors of the coup since it positioned the military and the civilian government on completely opposing sides of a very contentious issue.</div>
